 "subtitle": "1245555, Stress is a common part of life, but too much stress can affect your body and mind. One of the most common problems caused by stress is trouble sleeping. You may find it hard to fall asleep, wake up often during the night, or feel tired even after sleeping. When your mind is busy with worries or pressure from school, work, or personal life, it can be hard to relax and rest properly. Not getting enough sleep can make stress even worse. You might feel more tired, upset, or have trouble focusing during the day. This can create a cycle where stress causes poor sleep, and poor sleep causes more stress. It’s important to take care of your mental health and find ways to manage stress. Simple steps like taking deep breaths, going for a walk, talking to someone you trust, or taking breaks from screens can help your mind relax. Keeping a regular sleep schedule, avoiding caffeine late in the day, and creating a calm bedtime routine can also improve sleep. If stress or sleep problems continue, talking to a doctor or counselor can really help. You don’t have to go through it alone—support is always available."
