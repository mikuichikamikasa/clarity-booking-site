HOW TO UPDATE THE NEWSLETTER PAGE
=================================

Hi! This file explains how to easily update your newsletter content.

STEP 1: FIND THE NEWSLETTER FILE
--------------------------------
Look for the file called: "newsletter-content.json"
This file contains all your newsletter content.

STEP 2: OPEN THE FILE
--------------------
You can open this file with any text editor:
- Notepad (Windows)
- TextEdit (Mac)
- Or any text editor you prefer

STEP 3: EDIT THE CONTENT
-----------------------
In the file, you'll see sections like this:

"title": "Newsletter"
- Change "Newsletter" to your desired title

"textSize": 2
- Change this number to control text size:
  * 1 = Small text
  * 2 = Medium text (recommended)
  * 3 = Large text

"text": "Your paragraph content here"
- Replace the text between quotes with your content
- Each paragraph should be in its own section

STEP 4: ADD MORE PARAGRAPHS
--------------------------
To add a new paragraph, copy this format:

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Your new paragraph text here"
    },

(Don't forget the comma at the end!)

STEP 5: SAVE AND PUBLISH
-----------------------
1. Save the newsletter-content.json file
2. Commit and push your changes to GitHub
3. The website will automatically update!

IMPORTANT TIPS:
- Always keep the quotes around your text
- Don't remove the commas and brackets
- If something breaks, you can always restore from backup

EXAMPLE:
-------
{
  "title": "Monthly Mental Health Newsletter",
  "textSize": 2,
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Welcome to this month's newsletter! I'm excited to share some insights about managing stress during the holiday season."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "This month I want to focus on the importance of setting boundaries with family and friends during busy times."
    }
  ]
}
